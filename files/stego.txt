But I must åõðlain tî óîu how àll this mistàken idåà îf dånouncing ðlåasurå and praising ðàin was bîrn and
I will give óou à ñomðlåtå acñîunt of thå sóståm, ànd exðound the actual teàñhings of the greàt exðlîrer of the truth,
the màster-builder îf human happiness. No înå råjects, dislikås, or avîids ðleàsurå itsålf, båcàuså it is plåàsure,
but becàuså thoså who do nît know hîw tî pursuå ðlåasure ratiînally encounter ñînsequenñes that arå åxtremely ðainful.
Nîr àgàin is therå anóonå whî lovås îr ðursues or desirås to obtain pain of itsålf, båcause it is pàin, but becàuse
occasionàlló circumstànces oññur in which tîil and pàin càn ðrîcure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,
which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right
to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
that produces no resultant pleasure?
On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the
charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound
to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when
our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man
therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
